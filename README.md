## Description

This was an Android App I created for my mobile development course. It was created with an old version of Gradle on my old laptop
and has a different file structure to current 8.x Gradle version with some depreciated components. I am looking to migrate it to
a new 8.x project, but it is currently on the backburner.

The app has three activities that were navigated to using a snackbar component.

* The main screen was used to track the player character's current stats and the modifiers to rolls given by those stats.

*  The second screen allowed the user to track how many spells from each level they've used that day.

*  The third screen allowed the user to roll a selected collection of dice. For example, the user could roll two d6, a d8, and a d10 at the same time.
